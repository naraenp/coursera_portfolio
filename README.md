# coursera_portfolio

Public repository of Coursera coursework submissions, with focus on applied
data science and end-to-end ML project execution.

## Motivation

This repo shows structured learning progression and practical implementation:

- data collection and wrangling,
- exploratory analysis,
- model training and comparison,
- dashboard-oriented communication.

## Main Project

`applied_ds_capstoneproj/` includes the SpaceX launch prediction capstone with:

- web/API data gathering,
- feature engineering,
- model comparison,
- visualization/dashboard artifacts.

## Recommended future cleanup

- split large notebooks into stage-specific notebooks/scripts,
- add dependency lock files for reproducibility,
- summarize model metrics clearly in project-level docs.
